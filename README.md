# COMP 3123 Assignments
### Year: 2021
A folder of the two projects we were tasked with making for COMP 3123 (Full Stack Development I). 

The first assignment was mostly an introduction to Express and how to get things running on Postman, and the second was to show us how to combine front end and back end. 
For the second assignment, we were supposed to separate the front end and back end projects into separate folders, which is why they're in separate folders in this repo.

## Technical Details:
### Assignment 1:<br/>
**Back End:** Node.js, Express.js


### Assignment 2:<br/>
**Front End:** React, Bootstrap<br/>
**Back End:**  MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose


## How to Run:
1. Open the `.sln` (Project Solution) file located in each of the folders for the program.
2. For Assignment 2, make sure you paste your MongoDB database URL into `app.js`
3. From there, all you should need to do is run the program. You may need to build the project first.
    - Be sure to have Postman, as that's the only way to test and work with Assignment 1.
